# My personal dotfiles

This repository helps me reinstall my Mac with almost no effort

It's a fork of [Frederick Vanbrabant' .dotfiles repository]([https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles)).

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions. 

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:moisish/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
